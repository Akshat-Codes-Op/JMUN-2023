                <div class="text">
                    Seth M.R. Jaipuria School, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow began its journey in 1992. It is recognized as one
                    of
                    the creme-de-la-creme names in education in India which provides education from play group to grade
                    12.
                    We are guided by the Philosophy of Education promulgated by Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. We believe
                    in
                    partnership with our parents to impart value based education to our children that would chisel them
                    into
                    good human beings, for education is not about getting 90% alone; it is about believing in and living
                    the
                    spirit of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam".

                        About Navsrijan<br>
                        In November 2010 Seth M.R. Jaipuria took the initiative to start a school for underprivileged children.
                        We called it Navsrijan, a New Beginning, and enrolled 49 children in the first year. Today we have 340
                        children. We take care of all their needs and impart free education (same as Jaipuria School), inclusive
                        of uniform, books, IT education, fine arts and performing arts and sports. Besides regular classes, we
                        teach them Sanskrit, Yoga, Music and hone their skills in sports. It’s a matter of pride for us that 36
                        of the Navsrijan children joined mainstream school in the last 10 years and are now Jaipuria students,
                        securing a whopping average of 80% and above, beating the mainstream students. They continue to study in
                        Jaipuria School free of cost. Achievements:<br>
                        ● Navsrijan was the second runner up at Interschool Yoga competition hosted by SethM.R.Jaipuria School,
                        Lucknow .<br>

                        the title of ‘Man of the Match’ for being the highest scorer in ‘Sudhir Roy cup cricket tournament’.<br>
                        ● Anshu of class 9th , is a Frisbee player who played Frisbee with the teams of colleges like St

                    </div>
                    Being the simplest, thinking with words is limiting, higher than this is thinking with ideas but the
                    highest is thinking with experiences. So, we bring to you the 2022 ‘in school space’ inexhaustible
                    JMUN thinking experience after a skip in 2020 and the online experience in 2021.<br>
                    More often than not, we study under duress of the conventional responsibility of a student to
                    memorise information, do well in a testing system by becoming adept at answering anticipated
                    questions, so that the ultimate objective of a secure profession and a good position in the society
                    is achieved. JMUN ushers in an opportunity to study about world affairs past and present not to
                    fulfil this conventional responsibility but to do what you should do, to be what you should be so
                    that you usher in decisive and true progress.<br>
                    I look forward to all students coming together to enliven JMUN by stepping into different roles not
                    merely in the visible demesne but to augment their zenith in skills that life demands for
                    excellence. Information, analysis, ruminations, discussions, debates before deliverance are skills
                    that you need to lead a fulfilling life provided you keep a watchful eye on your intent in
                    presenting your opinion.<br>
                    As you conduct your role in the eight well chartered committees, ‘Be Reverent Of All points of View’
                    by putting each one in its true place without insistence on some to the exclusion of others.
                    Progress and the service of truth are based on harmony and not division. You will achieve this
                    larger purpose only if you consciously lead yourself to a deeper understanding and the widening of
                    your spirit by abolition of these limits of the self.<br>
                    Heartfelt Good Wishes for JMUN 2022 With the aspiration that in JMUN 2022, the Hall Mark will be
                    development of personal attributes that promote healing, compassion, honesty, and integrity along
                    with enthusiastic learning and an uncompromising quest for excellence.<br><br>

                    In the words of The Mother, “The more a mind is ignorant, the more easily it judges everything it
                    does not know or is incapable of understanding.” The aim is to rid this ignorance and grow as
                    responsible individuals that are an asset to society and the growing world at large.<br>
                    The world today is in crisis. There is no putting an end to organised crime, need for world peace
                    and sustainable development. If anything, these times have shown us the need for peace and diplomacy
                    using dialogue. The world has become a global village and no age is too young to prepare for the
                    future.<br>
                    For school students, a Model United Nations conference serves as an ideal stepping-stone into the
                    global arena.<br>
                    At Jaipuria Model United Nations, we aim to empower. We aim to grow and we aim to preach what we
                    intend to practise.<br>
                    The United Nations Model Programme at Jaipuria School aims to build and maintain strong links
                    between students across the globe. We teach students how to make their simulations more accurate,
                    and share knowledge of what the actual UN is like; encourage them to take real action to support UN
                    values and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br>
                    In the classroom, students learn from their teachers. At conferences, students learn from each
                    other. The conference does not replace the classroom; the conference complements the classroom.
                    Students have to internalise what they learn in class and deliver that information through speeches,
                    caucusing, and resolutions.<br>
                    Educational institutions need to go beyond conventional teaching and create curriculums that foster,
                    through the component of spiritual education, the spirit of humanity in their students.
                    I heartily invite all of you to join us as we commemorate the Tenth Edition of Jaipuria Model United
                    Nations.<br><br>
