        <h1 class="sec-heading">About Seth M.R. Jaipuria School</h1>
        <p class="sec-para">Seth M.R. Jaipuria School, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow began its journey in 1992. It is recognized as one of the creme-de-la-creme names in education in India which provides education from play group to grade 12. We are guided by the Philosophy of Education promulgated by Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. We believe in partnership with our parents to impart value based education to our children that would chisel them into good human beings, for education is not about getting 90% alone; it is about believing in and living the spirit of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"</p>
